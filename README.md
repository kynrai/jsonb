# JSONB

Library to help use PostgreSQL as a NoSQL DB via the build in JSONB type

All the advantages of NoSQL, all the power, portablity and flexibility of PostgreSQL

API inspired by the mongodb API

### *N.B.* Why not just use mongodb? 
You can of course, but its very hard to manage, not as widely available and sometimes you just want a simple NoSQL CRUD without having to deal with replica sets or write concerns etc.
